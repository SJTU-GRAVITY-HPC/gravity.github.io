# FAQ

  > Do not worry, contact us to change the password

```tip
You should use **private key** to log in to Gravity like this:
`ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_For_Gravity username@gravity.sjtu.edu.cn`    
The **public key** should be on the *Gravity* -> `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`   
Keep your **private key** safe, it is identical to **password**!
